# JavaSwing-Pong
My first "big" application, Pong! This project was one of the first 25 projects i made in Java (the first programming Language i learned). 
The project was created on 15/3/2021 and finished by 20/9/2021. I continued fixing its bugs though until 13/10/2021. Unfortunatly, after a ransomware attack, i was left with an old version of the game (the one that is uploaded). It is a shame. So many hours spent... I stopped working on it after that.

Anyway, let's continue. It was one of the first times i was using java swing. Now, that learned how Github works and have already published sone c++ projects, (yes, I am currently learning c++), i am also publishing Pong! the biggest project of my life (so far)...

Pong consists of 2 classes, Pong.java and PongTraining.java. Each class is kind of a different game: Pong.java is PvP pong while PongTraining.java is PvE. 

This project was originally an experimental where i would learn the basics of graphics, but it turned out to be a project. 

I added music and images with which someone can interact with to do certain tasks like turning the music off, pausing the game, restarting a game etc.

How th the game works: the game is inspired by the world-wide known game pong, so the goal is obvious.
Everytime the ball touches a paddle, the ball's x and y axis are inverted and the speed is increased.
